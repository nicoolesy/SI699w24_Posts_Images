# Decoding the Impact on Influencer Marketing: An Analysis of Sponsored Content Performance


## Introduction
Our research utilizes Instagram posts as data to investigate the impact of influencers’ sponsored content on electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) in social commerce. We aim to uncover key factors driving post-virality and audience engagement within the context of influencer marketing. We implement exploratory data analysis, natural language processing, and hypothesis testing, investigating useful features and identifying meaningful metrics that can effectively predict post-popularity. This study performs comprehensive analysis to provide actionable insights for businesses, enabling them to optimize their influencer marketing strategies. Furthermore, we conducted several experiments to build predictive models utilizing machine learning, and neural networks techniques, with a mean square error of 0.00106, enabling influencers to better foreseen their post’s possible popularity.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project 
Our dataset includes sponsored and non-sponsored Instagram posts, comprising 1,601,074 posts from 38,113 influencers and 26,910 brands from 2012 to 2019. The dataset is sourced from [Instagram Influencer Dataset & Influencer Brand Dataset](https://sites.google.com/site/sbkimcv/dataset/instagram-influencer-dataset?authuser=0). The dataset includes two types of files, post metadata and image files. Post metadata files are in JSON format and contain the following information: caption, user tags, hashtags, timestamp, sponsorship, likes, comments, etc. Image files are in JPEG format and the dataset contains 12,933,406 image files since a post can have more than one image file. Also, we obtain a JSON-Image mapping file that shows a list of image files that correspond to post metadata.

## Methodology
Our research methodology involved a two-pronged approach: statistical analysis and machine learning. First, we performed hypothesis tests to see if sponsored posts had higher engagement rates. We then employed time series analysis to explore trends in engagement rate over time. Finally, we built complicated machine learning models and neural networks to predict engagement rate and identify key features that influence it. This approach allowed us to investigate the impact of sponsorship on engagement rate from multiple angles.
